### IPv4 CIDR Range
``` 	
The allowed block size is between a /28 netmask and /16 netmask.

Currently, Amazon VPC supports five (5) IP address ranges, one (1) primary and four (4) secondary for IPv4. 
Each of these ranges can be between /28 (in CIDR notation) and /16 in size. 
The IP address ranges of your VPC should not overlap with the IP address ranges of your existing network.
